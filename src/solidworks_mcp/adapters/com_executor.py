"""
Single-threaded executor for SolidWorks COM calls.

Background: SolidWorks COM is STA (single-threaded apartment). An
``IDispatch`` proxy obtained on thread A cannot be invoked from thread B —
pywin32's late-binding surfaces this as
``AttributeError: SldWorks.Application.<method>``. FastMCP dispatches async
tool handlers on worker threads that are *not* the thread where
``connect()`` ran, so any cached ``swApp`` reference breaks.

This module provides a single dedicated STA worker thread (``ComExecutor``).
All COM work is submitted to it as callables and awaited via ``Future``.
Because exactly one thread ever touches COM:

1. ``CoInitialize()`` is called once at thread startup.
2. ``self.swApp`` and ``self.currentModel`` can be shared instance attributes
   without marshalling — no thread-local trickery.
3. STA constraints are satisfied (SW is happy).
4. ``_FlagAsMethod`` results accumulate on the same object lifetime.

Usage:

    executor = ComExecutor()
    executor.start()
    try:
        result = executor.submit(lambda: sw.ActiveDoc.GetTitle())
    finally:
        executor.stop()

or with the synchronous helper:

    with ComExecutor() as ex:
        title = ex.run(lambda: sw.ActiveDoc.GetTitle())

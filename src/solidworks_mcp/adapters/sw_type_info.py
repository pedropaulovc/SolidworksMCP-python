"""
SolidWorks early-bound COM interface resolution (with a flagging fallback).

Primary path — **early binding**: ``early_bound(obj, "IFace2")`` wraps a
pywin32 dispatch in the makepy interface class from a *checked-in* wrapper for
``sldworks.tlb`` (``._generated.sldworks_2026``), so members invoke by DISPID
via ``InvokeTypes`` — no per-name ``GetIDsOfNames`` round-trip. The wrapper is
vendored (not built in each user's ``gen_py`` cache), so startup never depends
on a writable temp dir or typelib discovery through a ROT proxy. Call sites use
``early_bound_or_flag(obj, iface, *fallback_names)`` and **reassign** the result
(``x = early_bound_or_flag(x, ...)``) — the wrapper is a new object.

Off-interface members FAIL LOUD: SW dispatches are polymorphic (a face is an
``IFace2`` and an ``IEntity``; a part model answers ``IModelDoc2`` and
``IPartDoc``), so a call site that reaches for a member the named interface does
not declare must bind the OWNING interface explicitly (``early_bound(obj,
"IEntity").Select2(...)``). ``early_bound`` returns a ``_strict_subclass`` that
raises ``AttributeError`` for any undeclared member instead of silently
degrading it to late binding — task #7 rebound every build/verify call site and
a full cold ``doit`` build proved zero off-interface accesses remain, so a NEW
one is a bug that should crash in development, not quietly pay the late-binding
tax again.

Fallback path — **method flagging**: for interfaces absent from ``sldworks.tlb``
(the undocumented motion methods) or when the wrapper can't load, pywin32's
late-binding sometimes resolves SW zero-argument methods (``GetTitle``,
``GetPathName`` …) as *properties*, so calling them raises ``TypeError:
'str' object is not callable``. ``flag_methods(obj, *interfaces)`` /
``flag_method_names(obj, *names)`` call ``CDispatch._FlagAsMethod(name)`` to
force method (``Invoke``) resolution for names that belong to the object's real
interface. Per-interface (not flag-everything) because each unknown name is a
~5 ms ``GetIDsOfNames`` round-trip and the full TLB has ~6 000 names across 482
interfaces; per-interface flagging is ~1-3 s, whole-object early binding is ~0.

This module:

1. Loads the checked-in makepy wrapper for ``sldworks.tlb`` (``gen_py`` and
   lazy generation remain only as compatibility fallbacks), plus lazily
   generated wrappers for the auxiliary typelibs in ``_AUX_TYPELIBS``
   (``swdimxpert.tlb`` — whose dispatches expose no type info, making this
   wrapper the ONLY way to early-bind them).
2. Builds per-interface sets of method names for the flagging fallback.
3. Exposes ``early_bound`` / ``early_bound_or_flag`` (primary) and
   ``flag_methods`` / ``flag_method_names`` / ``flag_doc`` (fallback).

    process-global map pywin32 consults whenever it wraps a dispatch that has a
    declared return interface (a ``returnCLSID`` on a method, or an element of a
    dispatch array). So the canonical multi-interface objects arrive as PLAIN
    wrappers: ``OpenDoc6``/``NewDocument`` → ``IModelDoc2`` (which is the *only*
    interface on ``adapter.currentModel``, yet the code calls
    ``IPartDoc.GetBodies2`` / ``IDrawingDoc.GetCurrentSheet`` on it),

    a plain wrapper an off-interface member raises ``AttributeError`` (or, when

    hazard task #7's rebinds eliminated.

    Re-registering every CLSID to a :func:`_strict_subclass` makes those typed
    returns behave identically to objects :func:`early_bound` wraps from a raw
    ``CDispatch``: a declared member is DISPID-fast, an undeclared member raises a
    LOUD ``AttributeError`` naming the interface — so a stray off-interface access
    on a typed return crashes in development instead of quietly late-binding (or
    silently defaulting through ``_attempt``). It also makes the
    ``isinstance(obj, cls)`` short-circuit in :func:`early_bound` correct: a typed
    return is already a strict subclass, so re-binding it to its own interface is
    a genuine no-op rather than a missed upgrade.

    NOTE (documented side effect): this is process-global — after the wrapper
    loads, ANY ``win32com.client.Dispatch`` of a SolidWorks object in this

    pywin32 late binding resolves members through SolidWorks's
    ``IDispatch::GetIDsOfNames``. A handful of methods are present in the
    type library (and the vtable) but **absent from that name table**, so a
    by-name call raises ``com_error -2147352573 ('Member not found')`` even
    though the method exists — ``IModelDocExtension::GetMotionStudyManager``
    is the known case. The early-bound wrapper class generated by makepy
    invokes by **dispid** (``InvokeTypes``), which bypasses the name lookup
    and works. It also drops the per-name ``GetIDsOfNames``/``_FlagAsMethod``
    round-trips that ``flag_methods`` needs (~155 ms/object) — the whole
    point of the migration.

    This reuses the already-loaded gen_py wrapper module, so the dispid comes
    from the type library for the connected SW version — nothing is
    hard-coded. The wrapper is constructed from the raw ``_oleobj_`` (passing
    the ``CDispatch`` itself drops the underlying IDispatch and breaks
    ``InvokeTypes``).

    The returned wrapper is a :func:`_strict_subclass` of the makepy class, so a
    member from a DIFFERENT interface on the same dispatch (``IFace2``'s
    ``Select2`` from ``IEntity``; a part model's ``GetBodies2`` from ``IPartDoc``)
    raises a LOUD ``AttributeError`` rather than silently late-binding. Task #7
    rebound every call site to the interface that declares the member it calls, so
    a surviving off-interface access is a bug — bind the owning interface at that
    call site (``early_bound(obj, "IEntity").Select2(...)``).
